MotiveWorld
===========

What Is It?
-----------

It's not really anything yet. The eventual goal is to create a simulation of a
world full of actors whose movements and actions are created by randomly
assigned 'motives'. The players will be able to influence this world by
designing a character that can be moved around or let to go to interact with
the NPCs.

For example, a character could be given several ranked motives: gain glory,
have a family, seek revenge, see the world, etc. The character would then
wander over a randomly generated terrain bumping into other characters with
different motives. Depending on the outcome of these interactions, the
character coud end up being killed, gaining followers, getting married, etc.
Characters would have to deal with 'natural' motives as well, like shelter and
hunger.

Again, it's nothing yet. But it's going to be an excuse to explore some cutting
edge web technologies: Canvas, socket.io, all that jazz.
